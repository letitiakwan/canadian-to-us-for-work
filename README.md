# TN Visa timeline:
This was how my timeline with Microsoft was: 

| Requested diploma for Early Release from university | Received diploma and uploaded to visa portal:  | TN petition filed with USCIS (under premium processing)| TN receipt notice from USCIS:  | TN Case approved from USCIS | Received original TN in the mail | Received onboarding approval 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 05/05/22 | 05/31/22 | 06/14/22 | 06/16/22 | 06/24/22 | 07/07/22 | 07/13/22

# Entering the States
The TN approval notice you get in the mail isn't actually a TN Visa. You need to get a valid Form I-94, and this is the important document that dictactes your non-immigrant status. At the border, you'll geneate your Form I-94. 
- Go to any U.S. port of entry, provide your TN approval and passport (you might need your diploma as well). 
- The official will generate a For I-94 for you. 
- A few hours later (up to 24 hours I believe), you can get your Form I-94 by going to the offical [I94 website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/), and downloading your most recent I94.
   - If it asks for document number, it's likely your passport number

# After landing in the States:

## Apply for your SSN
- Apply online for an SSN to speed up the process, then go in person to a SSA building. 
   - You will need a US address they can mail it to. And the mailbox needs to have your name on it (mine didn't so they gave me a label to put inside the mailbox)
- It should take up to two weeks to receive your SSN in the mail. 
   - If you don't receive it, you can go back in pereson in two weeks and they will tell you your SSN. 
   - It isn't that helpful to have just the number though, as you will likely need proof of your signed SSN card before for things like a credit card. 
   - I applied in person on July 20th, didn't receive my SSN in two weeks. Went back in person on August 3rd, and received it on August 13. 

## Get a US phone number
Having a US phone number quickly can let you set up Venmo, and pay less for roaming. 

Popular carriers: AT&T or T mobile
- You need an SSN if you don't want to get a prepaid plan. This might take longer. 
- I got a prepaid plan for one month at T-mobile. Super fast, walk into any T Mobile store. Didn't need an SSN and had a phone number right away
   - $15 for 3 GB, unlimited call / text in the States. Also cost $10 for the new SIM card

## Set up a bank account and get a debit and credit card:
First Tech Credit Union
- They will let you get a chequing account and debit card without your SSN (for Microsoft for sure). I opened an account the second day I arrived. 
- Go there with your passport, and potentially offer letter to set up bank account
- Once you get your SSN and proof of income (i.e. paycheck), you can get a credit card

## Sending money to friends
The U.S doesn't have e-transfer like Canada, and the system that banks use (Zelle), doesn't seem to be used widely. Most people use Venmo or Apple Cash. 

Venmo: 
- You need a US phone number and debit card. 
- You should be able to send money right away. 

Apple Cash:
- Switch your Apple ID region to United States. 
- Link a US debit / credit card in Apply Pay. 
- You should be able to send money right away. 

## Investing:
401k:
- With Microsoft, we use Fidelity, and we need our SSN first to set it up. 

# Highly recommended tips:
## Get a US dollar credit card before coming to the States
It is so extremely helfpul to have a US$ credit card. because:
- You might not receive your first paycheck until a while. 
   - My first paycheck is scheduled for almost one month after my entry date. 
   - You'll inevitably need to make purchases to settle down, and having a US$ credit card will help you avoid costly foreign transaction fees
- You can get Amazon Prime US!
   - This is so helpful for getting furniture, even groceries if your location has Amazon Fresh
